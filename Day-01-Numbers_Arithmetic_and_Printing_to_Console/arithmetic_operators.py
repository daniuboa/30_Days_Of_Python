# In python, we accomplish basic arithmetic through the use of arithmetic operators.
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers.

# Operator symbols include '+', '-', '*', '/', '//', '%', '**', '&', '|', '^', '>>', '<<'

# Addition operators
# Addition operator '+' is used to add two numbers.
# The result of addition is always a number.
# The result of addition is the sum of the two operands.

print( 5 + 3 )
print(6.4 + 2.3)
print(8 + 2.0)

# Subtraction operators
# Subtraction operator '-' is used to subtract two numbers.
# The result of subtraction is always a number.
# The result of subtraction is the difference of the two operands.

print( 5 - 3 )
print(6.4 - 2.3)
print(8 - 2.0)

# Multiplication operators
# Multiplication operator '*' is used to multiply two numbers.
# The result of multiplication is always a number.
# The result of multiplication is the product of the two operands.

print(6 * 3)
print(6.4 * 2.3)
print(8 * 2.0)

# Division operators
# Division operator '/' is used to divide two numbers.
# The result of division is always a number.
# The result of division is the quotient of the two operands.

print(4 / 2)
print(6.4 / 2.3)
print(8 / 2.0)
